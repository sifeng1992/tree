Tree Traversal:
It has three type of the traversal of tree(preorder,inorder,postorder).
(1)Preoeder Traversal: the sequence of traversal is root,left,right.The most feature of it is the first element is the root,and it can't
distinguish the left-subtree from the right-subtree.
(2)Inoeder Traversal: the sequence of traversal is left,root,right.If you know the root node ,then you can find out the left-subtree and 
the right-subtree trvaersal.
(3)Postoeder Traversal: the sequence of traversal is left,right,root.The last element of the traversal is the root.
